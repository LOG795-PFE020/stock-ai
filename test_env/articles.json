        "ticker": "NVDA",

        "content": "In a grandmaster-level chess move, OpenAI has signed a five-year, $11.9 billion agreement with the GPU-heavy cloud service provider CoreWeave, according to Reuters, which cites people close to the deal.\n\nThe deal involves OpenAI receiving $350 million worth of equity in CoreWeave, the sources told Reuters. The private placement is said to be separate from CoreWeave\u2019s planned IPO.\n\nCoreWeave filed to become a public company last week, but it has not yet priced or scheduled its debut.\n\nIt's a win for both companies. One reason this agreement is so eye-popping (besides the billions involved) is that before this deal, CoreWeave\u2019s biggest customer was Microsoft. In fact, in 2024, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave's revenue, which grew to a stunning $1.9 billion -- nearly an eightfold increase from just $228.9 million in 2023.\n\nBacked by Nvidia, which holds a 6% stake, CoreWeave runs an AI-specific cloud service with a network of 32 data centers that operated more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs as of the end of 2024, according to the company. Since then, CoreWeave has added more GPUs, including Nvidia\u2019s latest product, Blackwell, which supports AI reasoning, the company said.\n\nSuch dependence on one customer is usually worrisome for IPO investors and could have added \u201chair\" as they say, to CoreWeave\u2019s hopes of raising $4 billion or more in its IPO. Landing OpenAI as a direct customer in a multi-billion-dollar deal should help CoreWeave appease investors.\n\nWhat makes this move equally interesting is that it\u2019s another step in the deteriorating,\u00a0frenemies relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nIt\u2019s as if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman saw Microsoft\u2019s usage of CoreWeave and said, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\n\nNot only will OpenAI have access to the same cloud, but it will also have an ownership stake in the company that runs it.\n\nMicrosoft is, of course, a big backer of OpenAI in a deal that entitles Microsoft to collect a portion of OpenAI\u2019s revenue. But tensions between two companies have been rising for years, as OpenAI\u2019s fortunes have soared. OpenAI competes with Microsoft for enterprise customers and is even reportedly working on rolling out pricey AI agents.\n\nIn January, as part of the massive Stargate AI infrastructure deal with SoftBank, Oracle, and others, Microsoft ceased being OpenAI\u2019s sole cloud provider. OpenAI needs more compute resources. Just last week, Altman complained that OpenAI is \u201cout of GPUs.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Microsoft is working on its own AI \u201creasoning\u201d models comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3-mini. It's developing a whole family of its own models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI. It also hired Altman\u2019s rival, Mustafa Suleyman, to lead Microsoft AI.\n\nBut CoreWeave is a surprising chess piece.\n\nCoreWeave began its life as a crypto mining operation, founded by former hedge fund guys, it said. The three co-founders have already cashed out of $488 million worth of shares \u2014 over $150 million apiece. CoreWeave also has a stunning $7.9 billion of debt on the books.\n\nIf the IPO generates the billions of new capital they hope it will, the company says it will use at least some of that to pay down the debt.\n\nWhile these founders were once literally attempting to use GPUs to mint money, they are figuratively apparently accomplishing it.\n\nCoreWeave and OpenAI did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/in-another-chess-move-with-microsoft-openai-is-pouring-12b-into-coreweave/"

        "ticker": "NVDA",
        "date": "Mon, Mar 10, 2025, 8:50 AM",
        "content": "Quantum computing might sound like the kind of sci-fi plot device used to explain how a character traveled through time or shrank to the size of an ant. But the technology is very real, and Silicon Valley is increasingly jumping on the quantum train.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have each announced their own quantum computing chips over the past few months. Nvidia (NVDA) is preparing to host its first-ever Quantum Day as part of its annual GTC developer conference on March 20. IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), and a slew of quantum-focused companies also have their own chips.\n\nQuantum computers are expected to be able to complete calculations in minutes and hours that would take classic computers, the kind you and I use every day, thousands of years to finish. What does that mean in a practical sense? The potential for massive advancements in material sciences, chemistry, medicine, and more. After all, scientists and researchers will be able to run calculations they'd otherwise only be able to dream of with today's computers.\n\nBut what exactly is a quantum computer, and what makes it so special? We've got the answers you're looking for.\n\nTo better understand quantum computers, let\u2019s talk about classical computers first. Your laptop, smartphone, heck, even your smartwatch have processors known as central processing units (CPUs). These are the brains of modern computers.\n\nEvery CPU has what are called transistors. Think of transistors as little switches inside your computer that react to an electrical signal. You've probably heard chipmakers brag about how many billions of transistors their chips have. Apple talks up the 28 billion transistors on its M4 chips for its Mac and iPad, while Nvidia says its Blackwell chips have 208 billion transistors.\n\nCPUs translate the apps and programs you use every day via those electrical pulses using what is known as binary code, a kind of machine language made up of 1s and 0s. Each 1 and 0 is called a bit.\n\nStrings of bits make up the complex series of instructions that, after running through modern programming languages, are translated into the videos and images you see on your screen, the games you play, and the apps you use throughout the workday.\n\nOne series of electrical pulses could travel through a chip's transistors, creating various 1s and 0s along the way. The chip will then interpret those signals to access your computer's memory or storage. As the commands increase in complexity, they're able to interpret everything from a swipe of your finger on your phone's screen to what to do when you click on a link on a website.\n\nThese binary systems are used throughout computing, whether that's your home computer, medical equipment, cars, or virtually any other piece of technology that requires a CPU.\n\nQuantum computers, however, use subatomic objects known as quantum bits, or qubits, rather than classic bits. This is a completely different way of storing and processing data. Rather than existing as a 1 or a 0 like a bit, qubits can exist as a 1 and 0 or any combination of the two at the same time, thanks to what is called superposition.\n\n\"Think of a qubit as a sphere,\" explained Oskar Painter, director of quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services. \"There's a north and south pole, and it can be any combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously.\"\n\nTo make things even stranger, scientists don't actually know whether a qubit is a 1 or a 0 until they observe it.\n\n\"In the quantum world, the system itself can simultaneously be in several different states,\" NYU assistant professor of applied physics Rupak Chatterjee told Yahoo Finance. \"And until we measure, we don't really know, necessarily, which exact state it's in.\"\n\nThat ability to exist as a 1 and a 0 enables what is called parallel processing, which allows quantum computers to solve calculations much faster than classic computers.\n\nThere are multiple ways to manipulate qubits, whether that's through superconducting systems that lower the temperature around the qubits to near absolute zero, using lasers to interact with atoms, or taking advantage of light particles \u2014 photons \u2014 in an extreme vacuum.\n\nThose giant, gold, octopus-looking machines you see that are often referred to as quantum computers? They're largely cooling systems working with superconducting qubits to ensure they're sufficiently cold to operate properly.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, quantum computers don't exist on their own. They connect to traditional computers, which control how the quantum system should interact with a qubit and provide a readout of its performance.\n\nSo, quantum computers can use qubits' superposition to process calculations at incredibly fast speeds compared to our classic computers. Then why aren't we using them to solve the world's most complex problems yet? Because of quantum errors.\n\n\"[Qubits] are very, very fragile,\" explained Sridhar Tayur, professor of operations management at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. \"You can't have 0 and 1 at the same time if it interacts with the environment.\"\n\nSee, because qubits exist at such a small scale, they're incredibly susceptible to interference from the outside world. That means even a single atom could throw off the qubit, causing it to lose the information \u2014 that 1 and 0.\n\nAccording to Painter, quantum systems can have an error every 300 quantum operations. In order for a quantum computer to be useful, though, it can only exhibit an error every trillion operations. That's a dramatic difference.\n\nTo address this, companies use what is known as quantum error correction. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon focused on this with their latest chips. The idea behind quantum error correction is to use redundant qubits.\n\n\"If I want to protect one qubit of information, I need to actually replicate it 1,000 times in order to get a single good, what we call logical qubit,\" Painter said.\n\nBut that takes up a huge amount of resources. Researchers are working to address the issue, but until they can, quantum computers won't be reliable enough to use for calculations related to chemistry, to help discover new compounds, or to understand how atoms interact with each other.\n\nWhile quantum computers are helpful for running specific algorithms and solving incredibly complex problems, they won't replace classic supercomputers even after researchers are able to overcome the issue with quantum errors.\n\nThat's because they're not meant to do things like run your favorite apps faster than your smartphone. What's more, there's simply no reason to use a quantum computer for such a task when classic computers are designed to handle exactly that.\n\nIn other words, don't expect to come home, turn on your personal quantum computer, and start streaming Netflix. Your Roku can handle that just fine on its own.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds Investors: 193\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC said NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become the \u201codd man\u201d among the Mag. 7 group amid the dependence of many other companies on it and several other vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really Apple or Microsoft or Amazon or Alphabet or Meta or Tesla. It\u2019s the odd man out of the Magnificent 7: it\u2019s Nvidia, the most important stock in this entire stock market. Nvidia holds the key to countless tech companies. Plus, Nvidia now might be hurt by the president of the United States, who wants to tighten Chinese export controls further. The most exposed group might be semiconductor capital, with Nvidia being the most visible potential casualty. Some are going so far as to say that Nvidia holds the key to the fortunes of big momentum stocks like Paler, Apple, IT service now, and even Bitcoin. Can you imagine?\u201d\n\nThe market will keep punishing Nvidia for not coming up to its gigantic (and sometimes unrealistic) growth expectations. About 50% of the company\u2019s revenue comes from large cloud providers, which are rethinking their plans amid the DeepSeek launch and looking for low-cost chips. Nvidia\u2019s Q1 guidance shows a 9.4% QoQ revenue growth, down from the previous 12% QoQ growth. Its adjusted margin is expected to be down substantially as well to 71%. The market does not like when Nvidia fails to post a strong quarterly beat. The stock will remain under pressure in the coming quarters when the company will report unimpressive growth.\n\nNvidia is facing challenges at several levels. Competition is one of them. Major competitors like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD are vying for TSMC\u2019s 3nm capacity, which could limit Nvidia\u2019s access to these chips. Why? Because Nvidia also uses\u00a0 TSMC\u2019s 3nm process nodes. Nvidia is also facing direct competition from other giants that are deciding to make their own chips. Amazon, with its Trainium2 AI chips, offers alternatives. Trainium2 chips could provide cost savings and superior computational power, which could shift AI workloads away from Nvidia\u2019s offerings. Apple is reportedly working with Broadcom to develop an AI server processor. Intel is also trying hard to get back into the game with Jaguar Shores GPU process, set to be produced on its 18A or 14A node.\n\nOverall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of top stocks everyone is talking about these days. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Talking in a latest program on CNBC, Niles cited Microsoft\u2019s latest statement:\n\n\u201cI look at what the biggest spender of AI capex is saying, which is Microsoft. One of the things that\u2019s driving the market down today is IR from Microsoft in Australia, and they\u2019re sort of clarifying some of the notes that came out on Friday. They\u2019re saying, \u201cRight, you know, we think supply and demand are going to be in balance by the end of our fiscal year, which, by the way, is June, so it\u2019s not that far away, and we think our capex growth is going to slow to more in line with our revenue growth.\u201d Well, capex growth is running 50 to 60%, while revenue growth is running in the mid-teens. So you look at that, and you go, \u201cOkay, well that pretty much confirms the fact that capex is going to slow down.\u201d So for the Nvidia print, it\u2019s more interesting to just see what they have to say. Jensen looks out 10 years in.\u201d\n\nMairs & Power Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUnlike the dot-com companies that operated at the turn-of-the-century, many of today\u2019s technology companies are established businesses with significant cash flows. We have argued, and continue to argue, that many of these investments are perfectly aligned with our investments process in that they embody durable competitive advantages, above-average growth prospects, and excellent management teams.\n\nOverall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of top stocks everyone is talking about these days.
