**Stock Sentiment Analysis**

**Overview**

**This project performs sentiment analysis on financial news and social media to assess the market sentiment for a given stock ticker or name. It scrapes data from multiple sources, processes it using a fine-tuned machine learning model, and outputs a sentiment score (e.g., positive, neutral, negative) along with a relevance score, reflecting data from today’s date.**

**Features**

* **Input**: Stock ticker (e.g., **AAPL**) or name (e.g., **Apple**).
* **Output**: Sentiment score (positive, neutral, negative) with a relevance score (0 to 1).
* **Data Sources**:
  * **WallStreet Journal**
  * **YahooFinance**
  * **Reddit (e.g., r/stocks, r/investing)**
  * **Twitter (stock-related hashtags and mentions)**
* **Date Filter**: Only data from today’s date is analyzed.
* **Model**: Fine-tuned FinBERT or FinBERT-tone.
* **Dataset**: Alpha Vantage or similar for training and validation.

**Architecture**

* **Webscraping Module**: Collects raw text data from specified sources based on the stock ticker or name.
* **Data Preprocessing Module**: Cleans and prepares the scraped data (e.g., removes HTML tags, normalizes text).
* **Sentiment Analysis Module**: Processes the cleaned data using the fine-tuned model to determine sentiment.
* **Output Module**: Compiles and formats the sentiment score and relevance into a structured output (e.g., JSON).

**Data Sources**

* **WallStreet Journal**: Scrapes articles mentioning the stock ticker or name.
* **YahooFinance**: Retrieves news articles and discussion threads related to the stock.
* **Reddit**: Monitors relevant subreddits for posts or comments mentioning the stock.
* **Twitter**: Tracks tweets with the stock ticker or associated hashtags (e.g., **#AAPL**).

**Models**

* **Base Model**: FinBERT or FinBERT-tone, pre-trained on financial text.
* **Fine-Tuning**:
  * **Use datasets like Alpha Vantage or Financial PhraseBank to adapt the model to stock-specific sentiment.**
  * **Fine-tune on labeled financial text to improve accuracy.**
* **Training**:
  * **Split data into 80% training and 20% validation sets.**
  * **Apply 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.**
  * **Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.**

**API Endpoints**

* **GET /sentiment**:

  * **Parameters**:
    * **ticker** (string): Stock ticker or name.
  * **Response**: JSON object with:
    * **sentiment**: String (positive, neutral, negative)
    * **relevance**: Float (0 to 1, relevance to the stock)
    * **date**: String (today’s date in YYYY-MM-DD format)

  **Example response:**
  **json**

  ```json
  {
  "sentiment":"positive",
  "relevance":0.87,
  "date":"2023-10-05"
  }
  ```

**Dependencies**

* **Python Libraries**:
  * **requests**: For making HTTP requests to APIs or websites.
  * **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing and scraping HTML content.
  * **tweepy**: For accessing the Twitter API.
  * **pandas**: For data manipulation and storage.
  * **numpy**: For numerical computations.
* **Machine Learning Frameworks**:
  * **PyTorch**: For model training and inference.
  * **Transformers**: For leveraging pre-trained models like FinBERT.
* **Other Tools**:
  * **Alpha Vantage API key: For accessing financial datasets (if used).**

**Development Guidelines**

* **Coding Standards**: Adhere to PEP8 for Python code consistency.
* **Testing**:
  * **Write unit tests for each module (webscraping, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, output).**
  * **Use **pytest** for automated testing.**
* **Documentation**:
  * **Include inline comments for complex logic.**
  * **Provide a **README.md** with setup instructions, usage examples, and API details.**

**Deployment**

* **Environment**: Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment.
* **Hosting**: Deploy on AWS (e.g., EC2, Lambda), GCP, or a local server.
* **Monitoring**: Implement logging and error tracking with tools like Sentry or a custom logging solution.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Alpha Vantage API**: While Alpha Vantage offers sentiment data, its free tier is limited (e.g., 5 calls per minute). This project prioritizes webscraping over relying solely on its API, using it instead for supplementary training data if needed. Cache results to manage rate limits.
* **Webscraping Ethics**: Respect each source’s terms of service. Use rate limiting, user-agent rotation, and proper attribution to avoid blocks.
* **Model Selection**: FinBERT-tone may be preferred if tone-specific analysis (e.g., bullish vs. bearish) is desired over general sentiment.
* **Relevance Scoring**: Calculate relevance based on the frequency and context of ticker/name mentions in the text, normalized between 0 and 1.
